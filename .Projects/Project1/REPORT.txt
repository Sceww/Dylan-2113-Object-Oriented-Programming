1. I did not receive assistance from anyone for this assignment, but I did use online resources such as Google and stackoverflow.com to troubleshoot problems I was having with the Scanner class.
2. I believe that everything I did for this project is correct. There are two Arrays, one for storing item names and one for storing their 'checked off' status, I made the menu easy to use and account for errors, and my code is well commented.
3. I had originally made a 'Grocery' class to keep track of whether or not an item was 'checked off' and their name, but I removed it when I read the Technical Requirements section of the instructions. Replacing the Grocery Array with String and Boolean arrays wasn't difficult, as name searching used Strings anyways and it was easy to replace the checking off functions.
