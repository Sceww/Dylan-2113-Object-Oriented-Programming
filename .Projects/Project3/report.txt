1. I didn't receive personal assistance from anybody for this assignment. I did however refer back to lecture slideshows and websites such as w3schools.com and geeksforgeeks.org to help me understand some of the sorting methods used and to help me understand what methods were used for what.
2. I believe everything I did was correct. I implemented my own sorting and searching algorithms, made sure patients were only able to edit their own information, made sure changed information was saved to file, and I believe I made the program handle exceptions well.
3. I had a hard time understanding what the assignment wanted me to make exactly (Login? PatientManager? Driver? What goes in them? How do they connect?). After working on them, the flow of the program made a little more sense to me.
