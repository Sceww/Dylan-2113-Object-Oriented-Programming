1. I utilised the slideshows and the internet to help me with this project.
2. I think everything I have done here is correct, but could be improved. I had wanted to use more generic methods, but due to the way Java handles generic types, this was not possible. For example, I had thought I could combine Manager's getShortestMovie() and getShortestAlbum() methods into one generic method, but iterating over the list and casting to a specified type isn't possible. Something similar happened with getTypeProductCount(), where I had originally wanted to cast items of the list to a generic type, but it couldn't be done and so I compromised by utilizing the getType() method I implemented for all classes and comparing against a String. 
3. I ended up not using Generic methods or classes for this project, but I think it would be cool to be incentivized to do so.
